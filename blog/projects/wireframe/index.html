            Wireframe is a Game / Game engine built in C and C++ using the
            <a href="https://github.com/raysan5/raylib">Raylib library</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
The goal of the project is to build a simple, easy to use game base for my future projects.
            </p>
            <p>
So far I've been using the "Make the engine as needed" mindset when working on the project.
This will allow me to not overbloat the engine, or keep hogging the game making process on the engine development,
and will allow me to have a `base` and a grasp on a `engine` for my next projects.
            </p>

            <p>
There is some very early game concepts in there, yet to mature, but let's focus on the engine part for now.

            After messing arround with some game engines (most of this time was Unity), I've realized I don't
            really enjoy their workflow and the paradigms they imply in your projects.
            I always felt like they restrict the freedoms in your project, I wanted to go lower, I wanted to 
            manage
            everything myself. So when I finished the my game design classes (that forced me to use a 
            engine on their list), I started experimenting with Raylib, and almost instantly liked it's design.
            </p>

            <p>
            Raylib fits in a really nice spot on the Game engine / Game libraries market. Firstly, it solves a 
            "unsolved computer science problem", making a native GUI application easy. Yes you have, 
            all those other libraries at your disposal, but they always come with a learning curve and just throw
            everything on you all at once. Raylib wrapping either OpenGL or SDL, just simplifies the part that 
            should aready be abstracted by those libraries.
            <br>
            Second, it is very simple, and thats a good thing. Simplicity is one big factor that makes me 
            like something. No more stupid class hierarchy and weird stuff on my projects, No more giant .NET 
            runtime bullshit on my games. Just the simple game running there.
            <br>
            Third, it is C, and thats a good thing. C is the `lingua franca` of programming languages, most
            serious programming languages have a way to interact with C code. Another benefict of it being
            written in C is that it allows for the creation of bindings for infinite ammounts of other languages.
            </p>

            <p>
            TLDR: <br>
            Big generic use engine annoying to use runtime bad, want my own stuff, C good, Raylib good.
